/*
 * Dummy Bootstrap file
 *
 * GitHub Pagesâ€™ default theme (`jekyll-theme-primer`) expects to import
 * `bootstrap` from its SASS partials. Because this site does not use that
 * theme (we disable it via `theme: null` in `_config.yml`), the default
 * import would otherwise trigger an error during the GitHub Pages build.
 * Providing an empty `bootstrap.scss` here satisfies the import without
 * bringing in Bootstrap styles. This file intentionally contains no
 * Bootstrap code.
